1.What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

select charged_datetime, amount
from billing
where month(charged_datetime) = 3
and year(charged_datetime) = 2012

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?

select *
from billing
where client_id = 2

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?

select *
from clients
join sites
on sites.client_id = clients.client_id
where sites.client_id = 10

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created each month for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?

SELECT MONTH(created_datetime) MONTH, COUNT(*) COUNT
FROM sites
where client_id = 1
GROUP BY MONTH(created_datetime);

SELECT MONTH(created_datetime) MONTH, COUNT(*) COUNT
FROM sites
where client_id = 20
GROUP BY MONTH(created_datetime);

5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads we've generated for each of our sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

SELECT MONTH(registered_datetime) month, COUNT(*) COUNT
FROM leads
where month(registered_datetime) = 1
or month(registered_datetime) = 2
and day(registered_datetime) < 16
GROUP BY MONTH(registered_datetime);

6. hat query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?

SELECT count(leads.site_id)as Leads_per_client, concat(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as Client, leads.registered_datetime
FROM leads
join sites
on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
join clients
on clients.client_id = sites.client_id
where year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
group by leads.site_id

7. What query would you run to get a list of client name and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between month 1 - 6 of Year 2011?

SELECT count(leads.site_id)as Leads_per_client, concat(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as Client, leads.registered_datetime
FROM leads
join sites
on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
join clients
on clients.client_id = sites.client_id
where year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
and month(leads.registered_datetime) = 1
or  year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
and month(leads.registered_datetime) = 2
or  year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
and  month(leads.registered_datetime) = 3
or  year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
and month(leads.registered_datetime) = 4
or  year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
and month(leads.registered_datetime) = 5
or  year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
and month(leads.registered_datetime) = 6
group by leads.site_id

8. What query would you run to get a list of client name and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our client's sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.

SELECT count(leads.site_id)as Leads_per_client, concat(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as Client, leads.registered_datetime
FROM leads
join sites
on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
join clients
on clients.client_id = sites.client_id
where year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
and month(leads.registered_datetime) = 1
or  year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
and month(leads.registered_datetime) = 2
or  year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
and  month(leads.registered_datetime) = 3
or  year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
and month(leads.registered_datetime) = 4
or  year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
and month(leads.registered_datetime) = 5
or  year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
and month(leads.registered_datetime) = 6
group by client

SELECT count(leads.site_id)as Leads_per_client, concat(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as Client, sites.domain_name, leads.registered_datetime
FROM leads
join sites
on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
join clients
on clients.client_id = sites.client_id
group by client

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client each month of the year.

select concat(clients.first_name, ' ' , clients.last_name) as Client,amount,
sum(case when month(charged_datetime) = 1 then amount else 0 end) as January ,
sum(case when month(charged_datetime) = 2 then amount else 0 end) as February,
sum(case when month(charged_datetime) = 3 then amount else 0 end)as March,
sum(case when month(charged_datetime) = 4 then amount else 0 end)as April,
sum(case when month(charged_datetime) = 5 then amount else 0 end) as May,
sum(case when month(charged_datetime) = 6 then amount else 0 end) as June,
sum(case when month(charged_datetime) = 7 then amount else 0 end) as July,
sum(case when month(charged_datetime) = 8 then amount else 0 end) as August,
sum(case when month(charged_datetime) = 9 then amount else 0 end) as September,
sum(case when month(charged_datetime) = 10 then amount else 0 end) as October,
sum(case when month(charged_datetime) = 11 then amount else 0 end) as November,
sum(case when month(charged_datetime) = 12 then amount else 0 end) as December
from billing
join clients
on clients.client_id = billing.client_id
group by Client

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. Add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

elect concat(clients.first_name, ' ' , clients.last_name) as Client, group_concat(sites.site_id) as Sites
from clients
join sites
on clients.client_id = sites.client_id
group by Client
